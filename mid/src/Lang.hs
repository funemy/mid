-- Neutral terms are terms in elimination form, but cannot be reduced.
-- E.g., an application whose first element is a variable.
-- NOTE:
-- The intuitiion of why `Neutral` do not carry a type:
-- - Type is only used for eta-expansion.
-- - For all neutral terms other than NVar, the sub-neutral term is at the target position of an eliminator.
-- - Therefore, if we eta-expand them, we will need to immediately beta-reduce them, which is pointless.
-- - As a result, there's no point of eta-expanding those neutral terms, hence those neutrals not carrying types.
-- - For variables, the idea is similar. We don't want to naively eta-expand all variables, since some of them
-- -  might be in the target position (e.g. (App f x) where f is a variable). We only want eta-expand when we
-- -  are confident that this variable is also in normal form (i.e., a variable that's not in the target position).

-- Both of them are constructing types whose second element dependent the first.
-- In other words, the second element is a function (at type-level, conceptually).
-- Therefore, we represent them as VPi Ty Closure (VSigma has the same def),
-- where Ty represents the first element (a non-dependent type).
--
-- Since in DT-language, types and terms are the same thing, the Ty is simply a type synonym for readability

-- | Types are nothing special but values
-- I don't think there is a fundamental reason why Ty should be a synonym of Val.
-- We can alternatively define Ty as a synonym of Term.
-- This alternative definition requires some slight change in our type checking implementation.
-- Right now, we eagerly evaluate terms to the value domain, and lazily reify the values
-- back into term domain when we need to reason about their equivalences.
-- If we take the alternative definition, we will need to eagerly normalize (eval+reify) terms
-- to their normal forms whenever we encouter a type. This may bring some difference:
-- 1. We may not need to expose `eval` and `reify` separately, instead, we can just expose `normalize`
-- 2. As a result, the code in equivalence checking and toplevel will be slighly simpler, because the types
--    they are dealing with are already in normal form. We don't need to call `reify` anymore.
-- 3. One downside is about constructing types: now everywhere that's expecting a type accepts a term,
--    but term is a strict superset of val, so we need to be careful about the term we construct,
--    either by calling `normalize` everytime, or being super careful and only construct terms
--    in normal forms.
-- I guess overall, treating Ty as Term will incur slightly worse performance and make the implementation
-- less flexible while more error-prone.
type Ty = Val

-- Normal form
-- This is the resulting form we want for normalization.
-- Also the form which we will readback to recover a Term.
--
-- Notice that we do not need to include neutral terms here,
-- because neutral terms are also values (VNeutral)
data Normal = Normal Ty Val
    deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Typing context for dependent type checking
-- In DT system, typing context consists of two kinds of entries
-- 1. Variable declarations (abstractions?),
-- i.e., mappings from variable names to their types, introduced by Lam, Pi, and Sigma.
-- 2. Definitions, i.e., mappings from variable names to their definitions (values)
--
-- The reason for having the definition ctx is that we can have expressions in the types now.
-- Those expressions might refer to existing definitions (e.g., calling a type-level function.)
-- We could in theory having two contexts and manage them separately,
-- but that would complicate things like shadowing and computing used names.
