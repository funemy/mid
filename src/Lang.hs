-- In DT system, typing context consists of two kinds of entries
-- 1. Variable declarations (abstractions?),

-- The reason for having the definition ctx is that we can have expressions in the types now.
-- Those expressions might refer to existing definitions (e.g., calling a type-level function.)
-- We could in theory having two contexts and manage them separately,
-- but that would complicate things like shadowing and computing used names.
